## Best practices

### Dos

Counter badges should:

- Be hidden when count is 0
- Have a maximal count of 999. Once you reach higher than 999, the label becomes “999+”.
- Be used for counts of important information, close to the relevant item
- Notify the user that something is new or updated without showing a count, such as an “unread message”, or activity notification
- Notify or draw attention to changed values or status
- Be used when there is an underlying message in the menu
- Be used sparingly

### Don'ts

Counter badges should:

- Not be used if you need a text label. Use status badges instead
