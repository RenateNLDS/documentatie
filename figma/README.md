# The NL Design System and Figma

At NL Design System we work with Figma for designing components and patterns.

We collaborate and share knowledge on Figma with designers from the municipality of Utrecht, The Hague and Haarlem as well as Logius amongst others.

The goal is to offer proven components and patterns designed by these and other organisations as a ‘white-label‘ variant that can be tailored to suit your organisation’s own visual style and brand experience.

The address of our Figma team is [https://www.figma.com/@nldesignsystem](https://www.figma.com/@nldesignsystem).

## A shared design language

In Figma, we aim to bridge the gap between designers and developers. We opt to use for instance the same naming conventions as we do in our front-end codebase. This facilitates communication between designers and developers and helps streamline designer to developer handoff.
