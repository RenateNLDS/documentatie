Version history naming helps with tracking changes.

## When to save to version history

Figma auto saves files regularly. But it is also possible to explicitely save to Figma’s version history. This allows you to keep track of major changes and makes it easy to see a file’s history and roll back to a previous version when needed.

Every time you make a major change to a Figma file you should save it to the version history with a clear description of the changes. To save to Figma’s version history use `File → Save to Version History` or use the keyboard shortcut `⌥ ⌘ S` (MacOS) or `Control + Command + S` (Windows).

A prompt allows you to add a descriptive title and a text fiels to provide more in-depth details of the change(s).
