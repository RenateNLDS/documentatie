# Auto layout in Figma

Auto layout allows you to automatically lay out and distribute objects within a frame. These are one-directional; meaning that objects are either laid out vertically or horizontally. In order to apply auto layout in both vertical and horizontal direction, frames can be nested.

It can be used both on template or page level, or for micro layout of components. It can be compared to CSSâ€™ Flexbox.

Auto layout frames resize automatically based on their contents or dimension of objects inside them.

Auto layout can be used to add padding to objects, margins between objects and top, right, bottom, left and center alignment (both vertical and horizontal) and space distribution of elements within objects.
