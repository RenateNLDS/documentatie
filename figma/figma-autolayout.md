# Auto layout in Figma

Auto layout allows you to automatically lay out elements within a container frame. These are one-directional; meaning that objects are either laid out vertically or horizontally.

Auto layout can be used both on template or page level, or for micro layout of components. It can be compared to how Flexbox works in CSS.

Auto layout can be used to add padding to objects, margin between objects and top, right, bottom, left and center alignment (both vertical and horizontal) and space distribution of elements within objects.
