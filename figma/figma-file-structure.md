# File structure in Figma

A proper file structure helps in scanning and navigating Figma files. High-level sectioning (such as component groups, components, component specifications, or examples) helps quickly navigate to these sections.

The keyboard shortcuts `1` and `2` allow quickly zooming in on either the whole page or a selection respectively.

With proper sections and layers, you can zoom into a section or layer by selecting it from the layer panel and zooming in by pressing `2`. Zooming back to the either page or 100% of the current view can be done by pressing `1` and `0` respectively.

## Emojis aid quick scanning

Emojis in page and layer naming can aid quick scanning or provide a means to quickly check a status.

## Nesting

Avoid unnecessary folder nesting, but do use nesting to intentionally group related elements.
