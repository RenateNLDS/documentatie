# Creating components in Figma

## Variants

In order to create variants of components the best approach is to first create a component that contains all possible options and functionalities.

Functionalities not available in one or more variants can then easily be hidden.

Names of states should exactly match between component variants. This means also capitalisation of names, `focus=on` and `Focus=on` resolve in two separate variant instances.
